# Day 2

The earilest obscure elven machine code emulator question in Advent of Code history! Pretty easy but took a lot of reading. On the first part, I forgot to make the replacements the first time, so I lost a minute.

The second part was easy given the first part, and I took it by faith that I'd be able to brute force it since it's barely the second day. Plus a cheeky println at the end.
