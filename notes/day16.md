# Day 16

Another hard one, and I got 105th place on the global leaderboard for part 2 (so close). There's three keys to part 2:

1. An element can be calculated by looking only at the numbers after it.
2. The offset is more than halfway through the list.
3. After the halfway point, all pattern elements are 0 or 1.
